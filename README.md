👋 Hello there! I'm a passionate computer science enthusiast originally from Bangladesh, now residing in the United States. With a strong dedication to learning and growth, I have built a solid foundation in computer science, as evidenced by my published paper titled "Solar Powered Water Trash Collector Robot" in the 15th International Conference on Intelligent Human-Machine Systems and Cybernetics (IHMSC). My academic journey has been complemented by interdisciplinary expertise, including a minor in marketing and a CCNA certificate, which reflects my versatility and readiness to tackle diverse challenges. I'm particularly enthusiastic about cutting-edge technologies such as ML, AI, and NLP, and I'm eager to contribute to projects that drive innovation and societal impact. With a commitment to excellence, teamwork, and personal growth, I'm excited to connect with like-minded individuals and collaborate on meaningful projects that push the boundaries of technology.
